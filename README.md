This was forked from Captain Sensible's original.  I am removing some of the things I don't think are necessary, and adding a few that I think are necessary.  I will be creating two update scripts, one for desktop and one for Ubuntu server. All are intended for virtual machines running on either KVM or VMWare hosts.

# xupdate

A post installation script for fresh installs of Xubuntu 16.04 LTS

A lazy installation for repair shops or noobs

CREDITS: Internet

English or French

HOWTO:

1. download xupdate.sh

2. open a terminal

3. cd to the folder that contains the script (xupdate.sh)

4. chmod +x xupdate.sh

5. sudo ./xupdate.sh
